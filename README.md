# NoWayEngine
I found that on Microsoft Foundation Team, and a lot of older repos, I dont even remember which one was the right one, and I know this code is not my last version since I did not commit my last changes unifying my font render, my event handler and my windows manager interfaces. This is an really old code which ran on windows and I used VS to code, maybe in the future I organize this one and try to use it for the Vulkan API I want to learn in my free time.

I was at my time off from job, and I decided to make an engine for openGL using GLFW lib. I regret not have setup using cmake and cmake suport for VS sucked that time. Now I use Linux most of my time, and I need to port that. I made the VS virtual folder. Why did I do that to myself? I hate myself for that.

I was proud of myselft that time for implement Valve's font rendering, force opengl multi windows support and use a lot of inheritance event propagation with a windows paint system, I could do it a lot better now, but I still find that I could generalize even that time. 

Good old times when Brazil's Java only language came to my life :/
