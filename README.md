# NoWayEngine
I found that on Microsoft Foundation Team, and a lot of older repos, I dont even remember which one was the right one, and I know this code is not my last version since I did not commit my last changes unifing my font render, my event handler and my windows manager interfaces. This is an really old code which ran on windows and I used VS to coe, maybe int the future I organize this one and try to use it for Vulkan API.

I was at my time off from job, and I decided to make an engine for openGL using GLFW lib. I regret not have setup using cmake and cmake suport for VS sucked that time. Now I use Linux most of my time, and I need to port that. I made the VS virtual folder. Why did I do that to myself? I hate me.
